## Market Context

### Target Market
- **Segment**: Professional coaching services
- **Sub-segment**: ProActive Certified Coaches (1,000+ globally)
- **User profile**: 35-55 years old, corporate/HR/consulting background, 5-20 years coaching experience
- **Client profile**: Executives and senior leaders (VP, C-suite, Director+)

### Market Size
- Total addressable market: ProActive Certified Coaches (~1,000)
- Serviceable addressable market: Active coaches facilitating sessions (~500)
- Serviceable obtainable market: Early adopters willing to try new tool (~100 in Q1 2026)

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Differentiation |
|-------------|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| Miro/Mural | Full-featured, collaborative | Generic, expensive, setup required | Purpose-built for trust mapping, no setup |
| Google Drawings | Free, familiar | Unprofessional, clunky | Polished aesthetic, coaching-focused UX |
| Excel/Spreadsheets | Familiar, flexible | Visual, clunky | Trust expertise, real-time visualization |
| Physical worksheets | No tech friction | Not shareable, hard to modify | Professional digital output (PDF export) |

### Differentiation Strategy
**"Polished, purpose-built, frictionless"**

1. **Polished**: High-end visual design that enhances coach credibility
2. **Purpose-built**: Deep integration with ProActive trust framework
3. **Frictionless**: Session-only workflow—no accounts, no setup

---

## Constraints

### Timeline Constraints
- **v1.0 deadline**: 1 day (2026-02-17)
- **Implication**: Build on existing Claude edition foundation, minimal scope

### Scope Constraints
- **Session-only**: No user accounts, no persistence
- **Export-only**: PDF export, no cloud storage
- **Single modality**: Trust mapping only (expand later based on feedback)
- **Flexible cap**: 12-25 relationships (not fixed at 15)

### Resource Constraints
- **Development team**: Multi-agent AI system (Claude, Codex, Gemini)
- **Foundation**: Claude edition (2,346-line production codebase)
- **Budget**: No explicit budget (leverage existing infrastructure)

### Technical Constraints
- **Client-side only**: No backend required (simplifies deployment)
- **Static hosting**: Vercel or similar (free tier sufficient)
- **Browser support**: Modern browsers only (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox)

## Success Definition

### Product-Market Fit Indicators
✅ Coach completes full session without technical friction
✅ Coachee expresses breakthrough insight during session
✅ Coach asks: "Can I use this in my next session?" (re-engagement signal)
✅ Coach recommends tool to peer coach (referral signal)

### Anti-Patterns (What Failure Looks Like)
❌ Coach encounters technical issues during session (damages credibility)
❌ Coachee finds UI confusing or unprofessional (distracts from coaching)
❌ Coach abandons tool mid-session (usability failure)
❌ Coach doesn't return for second session (no stickiness)

### Success Metrics (v1.0)
- **Completion rate**: 90% of started sessions complete without issues
- **Coach satisfaction**: NPS > 8 from post-session feedback
- **Referral rate**: 20% of coaches recommend to at least one peer
- **Usage volume**: 5+ coaching sessions completed in first week

---

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Launch Strategy
- **Date**: 2026-02-17 (immediately upon v1.0 completion)
- **Channel**: Direct outreach to ProActive coach community
- **Messaging**: "Visual trust mapping for ProActive coaches—no setup, just facilitate"

### Distribution Channels
1. **ProActive Community**: Existing ProActive network, training programs
2. **Direct Outreach**: Personal invitations to early-adopter coaches
3. **Word-of-Mouth**: Organic referrals from satisfied coaches

### Pricing Strategy
- **v1.0**: Free (focus on learning and feedback)
- **Post-v1.0**: TBD based on usage and feedback (likely subscription or per-session)

### Feedback Loop
- **Qualitative**: Post-session email to coaches ("How was the experience?")
- **Quantitative**: NPS survey after each session
- **Advisory**: 3-5 champion coaches for ongoing input

## Risk Assessment

### High-Impact Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Technical issues during session | Medium | High | Extensive QA, 1-day timeline includes testing |
| Coachee doesn't find value | Medium | High | Coach training on trust mapping, clear guidance |
| Competitor releases similar tool | Low | Medium | First-mover advantage, coach community integration |
| Visual polish not "high-end" enough | Low | High | Designer review, iterative polish |
| Coach abandons tool mid-session | Low | High | Usability testing, coach onboarding |

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Technical issues**: 2-hour QA window before deployment, rollback plan ready
2. **Coachee value**: Clear trust definitions, coach facilitation guide
3. **Visual polish**: Codex agent specialized in design systems
4. **Usability**: User journey map testing, coach feedback on mockups
