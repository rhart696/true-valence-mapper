**Trade-off Note:**

- ❌ **Version history** - No need, sessions are one-time
- ❌ **Share codes** - Coachee takes PDF, no sharing needed
- ❌ **Cloud storage** - Too complex for v1.0, not essential for live sessions
- ❌ **Advanced nodes** (photos, badges, etc.) - Keep simple
- ❌ **Sound/video/motion** - Distracting, not needed
- ❌ **ProActive 5-dimension scoring** - Too complex, 4-level for v1.0
- ❌ **More than 25 relationships** - Executive networks fit in 12-25 cap
- ❌ **Undo/redo system** - Not needed with simple interactions
- ❌ **Mobile optimization** - Coaching happens on laptops/desktops (screensharing)
- ❌ **Multi-user collaboration** - Not group intervention, it's 1-on-1 coaching
- ❌ **AI-powered insights** - Not needed, coach provides insights
- ❌ **Coach account/login** - No storage needed, no account needed

## 8. Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: 4-Level Scoring Too Simple for ProActive Coaches

**Description:** ProActive methodology is 5-dimension (-5 to +5). Coaches may reject 4-level simplification.

**Probability:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** HIGH (coaches won't adopt)

**Mitigation:**
- Position 4-level as "ProActive-inspired" (not "ProActive-complete")
- Gather coach feedback after 5-10 sessions
- If coaches demand 5-dimension: Add as toggle in v1.1
- **Communication:** "v1.0 captures 80% of ProActive methodology value with 20% of complexity"

---

### Risk 2: No Persistence frustrates Coaches

**Description:** Coaches can't save coachee maps for later reference or track progress over time.

**Probability:** LOW (session artifact PDF serves most needs)
**Impact:** MEDIUM (some coaches will request persistence)

**Mitigation:**
- Make PDF export robust and professional (coachee can bring PDF to next session)
- Monitor coach feedback for persistence requests
- If 50%+ coaches request: Add coach account + cloud storage in v1.1
- **Communication:** "v1.0 is session-optimized. Tell us if you need persistent storage."

---

### Risk 3: 1-Day Timeline Too Aggressive

**Description:** Can't deliver polished, engaging tool in 1 day.

**Probability:** LOW (building on Claude edition foundation)
**Impact:** CRITICAL (project failure)

**Mitigation:**
- Start with Claude edition (production-ready, 2,346-line codebase)
- Remove unwanted features (persistence, share codes, version history)
- Simplify to 4-level scoring (already implemented)
- Focus purely on visual polish + session workflow (not new features)
- **Success Criteria:** 12-25 cap, trust definitions pop-up, PDF export - that's it

---

### Risk 4: Coachees Don't "Get It" Immediately

**Description:** Intuitive tool isn't actually intuitive to executives/senior leaders.

**Probability:** LOW (4-level scoring is straightforward)
**Impact:** HIGH (coachees disengage, coach credibility undermined)

**Mitigation:**
- Trust definitions pop-up on first score (callout, not modal)
- Visual hierarchy makes primary actions obvious (add person, click arrow)
- Test with 2-3 friendly executives before full rollout
- **Fallback:** Coach can demonstrate scoring on demo map in 30 seconds

---

2. **Measure success criteria** (technical, coach, coachee, aesthetic)
3. **Plan v1.1 features** based on actual user demand:
   - ProActive 5-dimension mode? (if coaches request)
   - Coach account + persistence? (if coaches request)
   - Mobile optimization? (if coaches request)
