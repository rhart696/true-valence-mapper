## Vision Breakdown

### What We're Building
- A professional-grade visual facilitation tool
- Purpose-built for ProActive Certified Coaches
- Focused on trust mapping as the core modality

### Who We're Building It For
- Primary: ProActive Certified Coaches (1,000+ globally)
- Secondary: Executive and senior leader coachees
- Not for: Therapists, individuals, teams (explicitly excluded)

### The Core Problem We Solve
Coaches lack a polished, professional tool that enables coachees to visualize their trust landscape in real-time during coaching sessions. Existing options are either too generic (whiteboards, spreadsheets) or too clunky (complex software), disrupting the coaching flow.

### Our Unique Value Proposition
- **Polished aesthetic**: High-end visual design that enhances coach credibility
- **Session-focused workflow**: No accounts, no setup, just facilitate
- **Trust expertise**: Deep integration with ProActive's trust framework
- **Immediate insight**: Real-time visualization that sparks breakthrough moments

### Our Aspiration

**To become the trusted tool that ProActive coaches reach for when facilitating trust conversations—where coaches feel prepared, coachees feel understood, and breakthrough insights emerge through the power of visual reflection.**

## Why This Matters

Trust is the foundation of all relationships, especially in executive contexts. Yet trust is often invisible and unexamined. By making trust visible and actionable, we enable leaders to make better decisions about who they trust, how they build trust, and where trust is broken.

This isn't just a tool—it's a catalyst for transformative conversations that change how leaders navigate their most important relationships.

## What We're NOT Building

- A consumer self-help app

- A therapy intervention
- A comprehensive coaching platform (accounts, history, analytics)
- A generic whiteboard or diagramming tool

We are deeply, intentionally focused: **ProActive coaches + executive coachees + trust mapping sessions**.
