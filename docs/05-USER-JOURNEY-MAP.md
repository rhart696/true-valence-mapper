## Appendix: Coach Facilitation Script

### Opening
*"Today I'd like to try something new—a visual approach to understanding your trust landscape. It's called trust mapping, and it helps us see patterns in who you trust and at what level."*

### During Naming
*"Let's identify the key relationships in your professional life. Think about who you work with daily, who you trust with important decisions, who you'd go to for support."*

### During Scoring
*"For each relationship, we'll score the trust level from High (you'd trust them with anything) to None (you don't trust them at all). There's no right or wrong—what's true for you right now."*

### During Visualization
*"Now let's look at your trust landscape. What patterns do you notice? Any surprises? What stands out to you?"*

### Closing
*"This PDF is your trust landscape snapshot. Take some time to reflect on what we've discussed before our next session. We'll revisit this and see what's shifted."*
