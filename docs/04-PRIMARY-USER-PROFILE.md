3. **Score (8-10 min):** For each person, assign a trust level (High / Moderate / Low / None)

> **v1.0 Note:** Unidirectional scoring only. Bidirectional (outward + inward) deferred to v1.1.
4. **Explore (5-7 min):** "What patterns do you notice?"

## 3. Tertiary Users: Other Coaches

### 3.1 Profile

**Who They Are:**
- **Personal growth coaches** (life coaching, relationship coaching)
- **Professional development coaches** (leadership, executive, career coaching)
- **Leadership development coaches** (team coaching, organizational coaching)

**Similar to ProActive Coaches:**
- Same context: Live 1-on-1 sessions
- Same need: Visual tool to facilitate trust mapping
- Same constraints: 20-minute mapping segment, must look professional

**Different from ProActive Coaches:**
- Don't use ProActive methodology (may have their own framework)
- Different coaching contexts (not just workplace)
- May target different coachee types (not just executives/senior leaders)

**Adoption Strategy:**
- Position as "generic relationship mapping tool for coaches"
- Offer optional "ProActive 5-dimension mode" if they want deeper analysis
- Allow customization of trust scoring language (if not using ProActive terms)

---

## 4. Excluded Users (Explicitly NOT Targeted)

### 4.1 Therapists & Therapy Clients

**Why Excluded:**
- Therapeutic focus (mental health, trauma, healing) vs. coaching focus (performance, action)
- Different regulatory environment (HIPAA, clinical notes) vs. coaching (less regulated)
- Different session structures (50-60 minutes therapy vs. 60-90 minutes coaching)
- Different goals (healing, insight) vs. coaching (action, results)

**Risk of Including:**
- Dilute coaching-focused positioning
- Add complexity (privacy, clinical notes, regulations)
- Confuse target users (is this for therapy or coaching?)

---

### 4.2 Individuals Doing Self-Development

**Why Excluded:**
- No facilitation context (self-directed vs. coach-guided)
- No session structure (use whenever, vs. planned sessions)
- Different motivation (self-growth vs. leadership effectiveness)
- Different accountability (self vs. coach/coachee relationship)

**Risk of Including:**
- Lose coaching facilitation features (session support, coach view)
- Dilute professional positioning (feels like consumer app)
- Waste features on users who don't need session workflow

---

### 4.3 Teams & Organizations (Group Interventions)

**Why Excluded:**
- Group dynamics vs. individual networks (team cohesion vs. personal relationships)
- Multi-user editing required (everyone contributes) vs. single-user (coachee builds map)
- Different goals (team performance vs. individual leadership)
- Different facilitation (workshop leader vs. 1-on-1 coach)

**Risk of Including:**
- Massive complexity increase (multi-user real-time editing)
- Lose focus on 1-on-1 coaching context
- Add features 80% of users won't use (most are 1-on-1)

---

## 5. User Journey Map

2. **Verify tool loads** - No errors, all features accessible
3. **Review demo map** (optional, if coachee seems tech-hesitant)
4. **Prepare screen sharing** - Ensure mapping segment is visible

**Coach Feeling:** "Ready, confident, no tech surprises"

---

### 5.2 Coach Journey: During Session (Mapping Segment)

**2-3 Minutes: Intro**
- Coach: "Today we'll visually map your workplace relationships"
- Coach: "See how arrows show trust in both directions?"
- Coachee: "Oh, I see. Green means I trust them a lot?"

**Coach Feeling:** "Professional, prepared, in control"

---

**3-5 Minutes: Identify Relationships**
- Coach: "Who are 12-25 people you interact with regularly?"
- Coachee: Names people while coach types
- Visual: Nodes appear on canvas as coachee names them

**Coach Feeling:** "Smooth, coachee is engaged, no friction"

---

**8-10 Minutes: Score Trust**
- Coach: "Let's assess trust for each person. Two questions:"
- Coach: "Outward trust: How confident are you that you'd go TO them if you had a problem with them?"
- Coachee: Reflects, answers
- Coach: Clicks outward arrow to cycle score (Green/Yellow/Red)
- **Trust definition pop-up appears:** "Green = High trust - 'I'd definitely go to them'"
- Coach: "Inward trust: How confident are you that they'd come TO you if they had a problem with you?"
- Coachee: Reflects, answers
- Coach: Clicks inward arrow to cycle score

**Coachee Feeling:** "I can do this. It's not overwhelming. I see my relationships."

  - "This one person stands out - I don't trust them and they don't trust me (red/red)"
- Coach: "Tell me more about that asymmetry..."
- Coachee insight: "I think I assume authority figures will judge me, even when they're welcoming"

---

**30 Seconds: Export & Close**
- Coach: Clicks "Export to PDF"
- Coachee: Downloads artifact, saves to device
- Coach: "In our next session, we'll compare this map and see what changed."

**Coachee Feeling:** "I have something from this session. I'll review it before we meet again."

**Coach Feeling:** "Session complete. Coachee has artifact. Ready for next time."

---

### 5.3 Coach Journey: Post-Session

## 6. Anti-Personas (What We're NOT Building For)

### 6.1 The "Self-Help Seeker"
- Wants solo self-reflection tool (no coach)
- Wants persistent maps across weeks/months
- Wants journaling, notes, long-term tracking
- **Why Not:** v1.0 is coach-facilitated, session-only

### 6.2 The "Therapy Client"
- Wants mental health support, trauma processing
- Wants clinical notes, HIPAA compliance
- Wants weekly therapy structure (not coaching)
- **Why Not:** This is coaching, not therapy

### 6.3 The "Team Manager"
- Wants to map team dynamics, group cohesion
- Wants multi-user editing (everyone contributes)
- Wants team-level insights, not individual relationships
- **Why Not:** v1.0 is 1-on-1, not group

### 6.4 The "Social Network Mapper"
- Wants to map 100+ relationships, entire org chart
- Wants complex analytics, network centrality metrics
- Wants social features (public sharing, communities)
- **Why Not:** v1.0 is focused 12-25 relationships, session-only

---

## 8. Constraints Summary

### 8.1 Non-Negotiable Constraints

**From Interview:**
1. **Polished, engaging aesthetic** - Visual impact creates premium feel
2. **Ease of use, intuitiveness** - Coach can use without friction
3. **Visual impact** - Creates "aha! this feels premium" moment
4. **Engaging-ness** - Not boring, keeps coachee attention

**From Context:**
5. **20-minute mapping segment** - Fixed time constraint in coaching session
6. **Session-only tool** - No persistence needed (export artifact)
7. **12-25 relationships** - Executive networks fit this range
8. **4-level scoring** - Simple enough for 20-minute segment

---

### 8.2 Flexible Constraints (Can Adjust Based on Feedback)

**Trust Scoring:**
- Current: 4-level (High/Medium/Low/Unscored)
- Future: Can add ProActive 5-dimension mode as toggle if coaches demand

**Relationship Cap:**
- Current: Flexible 12-25 (coachee chooses limit)
- Future: Can increase if executives demand >25 relationships

**Export Format:**
- Current: PDF export
- Future: Can add PNG/SVG if coaches request

**Visual Design:**
- Current: Priority order (1) Color scheme, (2) Typography, (3) Iconography, (4) Space, (5) Animation
- Future: Can adjust based on user feedback

---

## 9. Implementation Implications

### 9.1 Build on Claude Edition Foundation

**What to Keep:**
- Visual relationship canvas (force-directed graph)
- 4-level trust scoring (outward + inward)
- Click-to-cycle interactions (already intuitive)
- Smooth animations (already implemented)
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA, 100 Lighthouse)

**What to Remove:**
- LocalStorage persistence (not needed for session-only)
- Share codes (not needed for session-only)
- Version history (not needed for session-only)
- Toast notifications (not critical for live sessions)
- Supabase cloud storage (not needed for session-only)
- 8-person hard limit (change to flexible 12-25)

**What to Add:**
- Flexible 12-25 relationship cap (user-configurable or unlimited)
- Trust definitions pop-up callout (not modal, shows during scoring)
- PDF export (priority #1 for session artifact)
- Polished visual design (priority #1 from interview)
- Session support UI (cleaner, simpler than current self-service UI)

---
